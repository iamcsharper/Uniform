# Uniform
Uniform is a next-generation toolset for building microservices in typescript

## Main desired stack
1. React/SolidJS support for frontend microservices with rich shared ui components library
2. fastify + typeorm for backend
3. Nginx, docker, helm, kafka for backend services orchestration and communication
4. OpenAPI design first approach for building APIs

## Backlog

1. backend services compilation to WASM via https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript
2. powerful CLI with AST support to augment existing codebase with new models, routes, validations, etc.
3. rich package for solving common issues (authentication, shared database clients, etc)
4. easy and nice development experience even in local docker environment
