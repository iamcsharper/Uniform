# Uniform
Uniform is a next-generation toolset for building microservices in typescript

## Main desired stack
1. React/SolidJS support for frontend microservices with rich shared ui components library
2. fastify + typeorm for backend
3. Nginx, docker, helm, kafka for backend services orchestration and communication
4. OpenAPI design first approach for building APIs

## Backlog

1. backend services compilation to WASM via https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript
2. powerful CLI with AST support to augment existing codebase with new models, routes, validations, etc.
3. rich package for solving common issues (authentication, shared database clients, etc)
